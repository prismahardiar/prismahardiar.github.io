Beginning with real-number reasoning, inequalities, coordinate geometry, and the major families of functions (including exponential/logarithmic and trigonometric forms), the course develops limits and continuity as a rigorous language for approximation and stability. It then advances to differentiation as a framework for sensitivity analysis, curve behavior, and optimization, and to integration as a theory of accumulation with both analytic and numerical methods, including applications to geometry and physical quantities. The course also addresses differential equations, indeterminate forms, and improper integrals to handle growth, edge behavior, and systems without closed-form solutions, and it builds approximation power through sequences, series, and Taylor expansions. Finally, it moves into higher dimensions through vectors and multivariable calculus, covering gradients, constrained optimization, multiple integrals with change of variables, and the vector calculus theorems (Green, Gauss, and Stokes) that connect local structure to global behavior providing a coherent mathematical toolkit that underpins modern data science.\nChapter 1: Preliminaries Lecture videos Lecture video 1 – This is a first lecture video.

Lecture notes Lecture note 1 Topics Vector Fields Line Integrals Independence of Path Green’s Theorem in the Plane Surface Integrals Gauss’s Divergence Theorem Stokes’s Theorem Conclusion By the end of this course, calculus becomes a single, connected toolkit spanning limits, derivatives, integrals, series, and multivariable/vector methods for turning questions about data into quantitative statements you can analyze. You will be able to justify approximations, solve optimization and accumulation problems in one and many dimensions, and interpret the geometry that sits behind modern modeling.\nRigor + reliability: Real numbers, functions, limits, and continuity give you controlled reasoning about growth, stability, and edge cases (including indeterminate forms and improper integrals). Geometry + structure in higher dimensions: Gradients, multiple integrals, and the big integral theorems (Green/Gauss/Stokes) connect local behavior to global quantities such as flux, circulation, and conservation. “Truth is much too complicated to allow anything but approximations.” — John von Neumann\n",

<p>By the end of this course, calculus becomes a single, connected toolkit spanning limits, derivatives, integrals, series, and multivariable/vector methods for turning questions about data into quantitative statements you can analyze. You will be able to justify approximations, solve optimization and accumulation problems in one and many dimensions, and interpret the geometry that sits behind modern modeling.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rigor + reliability:</strong> Real numbers, functions, limits, and continuity give you controlled reasoning about growth, stability, and edge cases (including indeterminate forms and improper integrals).</li>
<li><strong>Geometry + structure in higher dimensions:</strong> Gradients, multiple integrals, and the big integral theorems (Green/Gauss/Stokes) connect local behavior to global quantities such as flux, circulation, and conservation.</li>
</ul>
